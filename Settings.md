# settings.json Instructions
Before we begin, make sure you have an application with a bot account created by going [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).\
**Token:** To get your bot token, go to your applications and under bot account, show the token. Copy and paste it into this spot.\
**Prefix:** The prefix is the part before every command. It can be any character that can be entered into Discord, or even a word/phrase, anything.\
**ownerID:** To get the bot owner ID, if you have developer mode on Discord enabled, right click yourself and click copy ID. Otherwise, put a backslash  before a @ and your username and discriminator. Example: `\@JacksonFovero#7959`. It should pop up with something that looks like this: `<@234461421667090432>`, the numbers are your user ID, copy and paste that into the ownerID section.\
**ownerName:** Very simple, just your username or name you would like to go by.\
**botID:** Can be found in your app settings on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). It is located in the `App Details` section.\
**botName:** Also very simple, the name your bot should go by.\
**botShortName:** Even simpler, if there is a shorter version of your bot's name, put it here.\
**avatar:** This can either be a directory to your bots image on the local system, or a direct link to an image. For example: https://i.imgur.com/IgdGUhP.png\
**color:** The main color for your bot.\
**errorColor:** The error color for your bot. Recommended to be red.\
**successColor:** The success color for your bot. Recommended to be green.\
**testing:** **VERY IMPORTANT** Change this to true if you are testing commands and you want only one person to be able to run commands, and that person is you. Change this to false if you want it to run normally and allow other people to use commands.
